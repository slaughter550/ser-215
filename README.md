Preface: The extent of my experience are the two classes I’ve taken this year through ASU (CST 100 Python & CST 200 Java).
This code is the result of me trying to learn java GUI. The program is user vs computer Battleship.
Work needed:
•	User game board
•	End Game
•	Surrender Button
•	Scoreboard
•	GUI upgrade
I understand that this code is really raw and rough, but I’m excited to learn from feedback and collaborate towards making an awesome project.
